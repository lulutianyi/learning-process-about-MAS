# learning-process-about-MAS
Here is my experience of getting a insight into multi-agent-system and computer vision. This repository would comtain essaies, kowledge and articles about these issues I collected.


1.a raw project in the very beginning
  I set an experiment based on the essay Sequential Diagonsis with Language Models. The vision and case files are too simple to be conducted as a research material. However, I tried to realize a bidirectional judgement method in agent fila. You can both use agent.py or agent2.py to conduct the main file, but you should notice the import part at the top of main.(Can't there be anyone to run my silly project!)
