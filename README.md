Here is my experience of getting a insight into multi-agent-system and computer vision. This repository would comtain essaies, kowledge and articles about these issues I collected.


1.a raw project in the very beginning
  
  
  I set an experiment based on the essay Sequential Diagonsis with Language Models. The vision and case files are too simple to be conducted as a research material. However, I tried to realize a bidirectional judgement method in agent fila. You can both use agent.py or agent2.py to conduct the main file, but you should notice the import part at the top of main.(Can't there be anyone to run my silly project!)

2.successfully conducted autogen project


After several days' trial and error, I gave up metagpt and agentmesh and finally run an autogen project on my computer. I was extraordinary excited when the autogen assistant agent answering my questions on cmd. Then I follow the guidance of grok and built a simple User-Coder agent system. However, this system soon locked because of the limitation of tokens from the openai. I remember around 99000 tokens were used after I ran the program for about 10 times. In the next running time my api asked another 1500 tokens and it met the killline.

Then I discussed this situation with my Academic Adivisor and she encouraged me to submit an implication to the CRIS Foundation. After rearranging my research interest and direction, I am going to join a 8-months-long research.
